iOSMessageExport
================
1. Make a directory somewhere (ex: mkdir ~/Desktop/iOSBackup)
2. Download these files
3. I reccomend copying your iTunes backup into your ~/Desktop/iOSBackup folder, but you shouldn't have to. Run backup.pl passing the backup directory. (ex: perl backup.pl --directory_path 9b9f73759fad7b31e330dd26bf7f745acccf1869/)
4. An _export folder will be created in your working directory with all of your files!
